                <div class="sep-line"></div>
                <p> Images are a projection of 3D scene onto 2D plane.</p>
                <p>We need to understand
                    the geometric and photometric relation between the scene and
                    its
                    image.
                </p>
                <p>To do so we should understand:

                </ul>

                <h2>Pinhole and Perspective Projection</h2>
                <div class="sep-line"></div>
                <h3>Pinhole Projection</h3>
                <p>The pinhole projection model is one of the simplest yet most
                    crucial concepts in understanding how images are formed in
                    cameras. At its core, it involves light passing through a
                    small aperture (the "pinhole") and projecting an inverted
                    image onto a surface placed behind it. This model operates
                    on the principle of light rays traveling in straight lines.
                    Each point in the scene being captured emits light rays in
                    all directions, but only those that pass through the pinhole
                    and hit the imaging plane create the final image.</p>

                <h3>Perspective Projection</h3>
                <p>Perspective projection builds upon the pinhole model,
                    incorporating additional complexities such as the notion of
                    perspective and depth. In perspective projection, objects
                    that are farther away from the camera appear smaller in the
                    image compared to objects that are closer. This effect
                    mimics how our eyes perceive depth in the real world,
                    creating a sense of three-dimensionality in the captured
                    image.</p>

                <h3>How They Are Used</h3>
                <p>Pinhole and perspective projection are used extensively in
                    various fields, including computer graphics, computer
                    vision, photography, and cinematography. In computer vision,
                    these concepts serve as the basis for understanding how
                    cameras capture images of the world and how these images can
                    be processed and analyzed by algorithms.</p>
                <p>Computer vision applications often rely on camera
                    calibration, which involves determining the intrinsic
                    parameters of a camera (such as focal length, principal
                    point, and lens distortion) to accurately interpret images
                    and extract meaningful information from them. Pinhole and
                    perspective projection models play a crucial role in this
                    calibration process, allowing computer vision systems to
                    understand how objects in a scene are projected onto the
                    camera sensor.</p>
                <p>Understanding pinhole and perspective projection is essential
                    for several reasons:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Camera Calibration:</strong> Proper calibration
                        enables accurate
                        measurements and reconstructions of objects in a scene,
                        which is vital for applications such as 3D
                        reconstruction, object tracking, and augmented
                        reality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth Perception:</strong> Perspective
                        projection provides depth
                        cues in images, allowing computer vision algorithms to
                        estimate the distance to objects in a scene. This depth
                        information is crucial for tasks like scene
                        understanding, obstacle avoidance, and robotic
                        navigation</li>
                    <li><strong>Image Formation:</strong> Knowledge of how
                        images are formed
                        helps
                        in designing and optimizing camera systems for specific
                        applications, such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles,
                        medical imaging, and industrial inspection.</li>
                </ul>

                    require long exposures to capture
                    bright images</p>

                <h2>Image Formation using Lenses</h2>
                <div class="sep-line"></div>
                <p>Lenses are optical components designed to focus light onto a
                    sensor or film, altering the path of incoming light rays
                    through refraction. They come in various shapes and designs,
                    each with specific properties that affect image formation,
                    such as focal length, aperture size, and lens
                    aberrations.</p>
                <p>When light rays pass through a lens, they converge or diverge
                    based on the lens's curvature and refractive properties.
                    Unlike the pinhole model, which relies on a single point of
                    light passing through a tiny aperture, lenses can gather
                    light from a broader area, allowing for brighter and sharper
                    images.</p>
                <p>The process of image formation with lenses involves several
                    key elements:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focal Length:</strong> The distance between the
                        lens and its
                        focal point, where parallel rays of light converge after
                        passing through the lens. Focal length determines the
                        magnification and field of view of the resulting image.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Aperture:</strong> The opening in the lens that
                        controls the
                        amount of light entering the camera. Adjusting the
                        aperture size regulates the depth of field and
                        influences the overall brightness and sharpness of the
                        image.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lens Aberrations:</strong> Imperfections in lens
                        design that can
                        distort or degrade image quality. Common aberrations
                        include spherical aberration, chromatic aberration, and
                        distortion, which can affect the clarity, color
                        accuracy, and geometry of the captured image.</li>
                </ul>
