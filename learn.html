            <h1>What is Java and why use it?</h1>
            <p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that
                was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle
                Corporation). It was released in 1995 and has since become one
                of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Java
                is known for its platform independence, which means that Java
                programs can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine
                (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and
                operating system.</p>
            <p>Key Features: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java is designed around
                    the principles of
                    object-oriented programming, promoting the use of classes
                    and objects for organizing and structuring code.

                </li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Java has built-in security
                    features to protect
                    against various threats, such as viruses and other malicious
                    software.

                </li>
                <li><strong>Rich Standard Library:</strong> Java comes with a
                    comprehensive
                    standard library that provides a wide range of pre-built
                    functionalities, making it easier for developers to perform
                    common tasks without having to write code from scratch.

                </li>
                <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Java supports
                    multithreading, allowing
                    developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks
                    concurrently, enhancing performance in applications that
                    require parallel processing.</li>

            <h1>Java Syntax</h1>
            <p>Every line of Java code must be inside a <strong>class</strong>
                and a class should always start with an uppercase letter. This
                is because Java is case sensitive TestClass and testclass are
                interpreted different.</p>
            <p>The name of the file <strong>must match</strong> the name of the
                class</p>
            <p>Blocks of code should be followed by <strong>{</strong> and
                closed by <strong>}</strong></p>
            <p>And when declaring statements and other lines of code in java you
                must end it with a <strong>;</strong> </p>
            <p>For example delaring variables in Java could look like this:</p>
            <pre>
                    public class Main {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                            // Declaring variables
                            int x = 12, y = 10;
                            boolean isTrue = true;
                            String greeting = "Welcome!";
                         }
                    }
                </pre>
            <p>While in a language like python it could look something like
                this:</p>
            <pre>
                    # Declaring variables
                    x, y = 12, 10
                    isTrue = True
                    greeting = "Welcome!"

                </pre>
